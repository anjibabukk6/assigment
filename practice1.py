# 6)Write a program to demonstrate the differences between list and tuple.
# a = [2,6,5,6,'anji']
# b=(2,6,5,6,'anji')
# print(b.index(6))
# print(a.index(6))
# print(a.count(6))
# print(a.pop(3))
# print(a.remove('anji'))
# print(a.append('babu'))
# print(a)


# 7)Write a program to get the following output.
#    Input: 'Welcome to python'
#    Output: 'ome to'

# a=input()
# b=a[4:10]
# print(b)




# 8)Print the following string in reverse order.

# a="anjibabu"
# print(a[::-1])



# 9)Write a program to get the following output
#   Input: [10, 5, 4, 20, 1, 15, 12]
#   Output: [1, 4, 5, 10, 12, 15, 20]
# list_a=[10, 5, 4, 20, 1, 15, 12]
# list_a.sort()
# print(list_a)




# 10)Write a program to demonstrate list and dictionary comprehension.




# 11)Write a program to reverse a string word by word.
# a= "a program to reverse a string word by word"
# b=a.split()[::-1]
# print(b)





# 12)Write a program to get the list of even numbers from a given list using list comprehension.
# 13)Write a program to create a dictionary using two lists
# Input: l1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# l2 = [1,2,3]
# Output:
# {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}



# 14)Write a program to generate and print a list of the first and last 5 elements where the values
# are square of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included)
# list_=range(1,30)
# list1=[]
# for i in list_:
#     list1.append(i*i)
# print(list1)
# list2=list1[:5]
# print(list2)
# list3=list1[-5:]
# print(list3)






# 15)Define index, number, and compare that the number exists in the list for a given index or not?



# 16)Write a program to find the list of words that are longer than n from a given list of words.







# 17)Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one
# Input:
# dic1={1:10, 2:20}
# dic2={3:30, 4:40}
# dic3={5:50,6:60}
# output:
# {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}
#
# dict1={1:10,2:20}
# dict2={3:30,4:40}
# dict3={5:50,6:60}
# dict4={}
# for d in(dict1,dict2,dict3):dict4.update(d)
# print(dict4)






# 18)Write a program to demonstrate all the available operators in python.

a=(2+3,2-3,2*3,2/3,2//3.2%3)
print(a)


# 19)Write a program to get unique values from a list.
